        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        Cookies are generally small and removable computerized pieces of information
        that provide a better insight into a user. The small file is stored in the
        location of the user’s devices. Cookies allow the sender to recognize the
        device in which it is kept throughout its validity terms. We also use other
        technological measures like web beacons. This will help us improve our
        application and provide users with a better experience.
        <h3>Use of the App</h3>
        <p>
          The app is built to work both online and offline, but an active internet
          connection will optimize the app’s performance with more accuracy. Qiblah
          Direction and Tasbih require no active internet connection but Salaah time
          at a specific location/ region, Hijri calendar and Find Mosque Nearby
          requires an active internet connection to synchronize with the GMT, Moon
          and Google Maps.
        </p>
